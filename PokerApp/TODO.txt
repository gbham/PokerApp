-Need to consider the blinds
-Also need to consider the person that starts the hand changes each time. First thoughts are to have a list of the players that changes after each hand played. I think just putting the player at position 1 in the list to the end should solve the issue.
-Need to handle min raises
-Need to add some instructions on format of user input and a help menu at some point
-If the money needed to call puts the player all in, then there shouldnt be an option to "Raise"
-Deal with ChipsNeededToCall
-******Make a structured list of tasks and features
-care with the difference between the hand ending due to someone folding and due to the hand ending cause someone is all in. I might treat some variables in too much of a general way
-Need to account for someone being all in on the river and winning, but they cant get all the chips since they were short stack, I then need to assign those chips to the 2nd best hand and I suppose even one more time in a very rare scenario, I might be able to loop whatever process I create until the pot is "cleared"
-Care with how I determine kickers, if it is a straight/flush then I have no choice but to choose one of those 5 cards. With most other hands I can use any in the 7 availiable
-the ability to muck or show hands
-ensure I have functions in the correct class, there can be some ambiguity with some functions that could belong to both Dealer/Board and maybe player. Keep these in mind and try find ways to seperate the functions into clearer categories 
-too much hassle to check if the regEx can return 2 matches on its own, since you then to remove the first match and run the regEx again anyway.
-For some functions, determing the kicker can be more alike that initially thought. If I am in the scenario where I know exactly what cards I need to find the kicker from, then the process can be pretty similar.
-ideas for custom UI default "layer": 5 show cards, chip counts, players in the hand. See what can be done in terms of a makeshift table being created in CLI
-Error with DetermineHighestCardFromTwoChoices()
-At the moment if there is only one kicker, specifically, the best kicker outside the "hand" (e.g Pair). Winners will be awarded incorrectly in rare situations until more kickers added. It probs wouldnt be too hard to scale up how some of the kickers are determined. If I have a list of only cards I need to decide kickers from, then instead of just assigning the highest kicker, I can create a new list, add the highest kicker, remove it from the original list and perform the search again for the next highest kicker, rinse and repeat
-Need function at the start to enter how many players will be playing and to assign names. Doesnt seem like it would be difficult. 
-make sure everything isnt case sensative or convert all user input to lowercase
-Have to check if the player has the amount of chips avaiable that they acre trying to bet  
-need to handle the situation where a player can only raise if they raise at least a certain amount, that amount must be greater than the value of the top bet this round by another player plus the min raise value
-if the formatting of the "ui" gets tricky with trying to display the last move made then I could just create another property that saves the last move each player made so I can display that at any time and not have to worry about the timing of other functions and where my Console.Clear()'s are placed
-maybe create tab autocomplete functionality or just the ability to tab through the options right off the bat
-at the moment there is no stopping the user from making any move at any time. What I mean is some moves are illegal in certain situations
-no time to check but noticed a time when All-in was being showing incorrectly, (guy with 1500 chips showsed "All-In" against 2 players with 0)
-if player has no chips left then i need to not show their chip count, or at least make sure the HasCards property is updated to false, maybe just remove them from Players[] but not sure what indirect issues that could cause. The player with no chips would be ignored during the turns anyway since they have no chips. Must ensure HasCards variable is changed tho as that is used to determine who can win a hand I believe
-need to have a chipBetThisRound in the print game information function
-if i really want to show this - "Console.WriteLine($"[{this.Name}] has placed a bet of [{value}] chips.");" then I could just do another Console.ReadKey() after it so the user needs to hit a key before the next player will be presented with their move options
