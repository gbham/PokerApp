-Need to consider the blinds
-Also need to consider the person that starts the hand changes each time. First thoughts are to have a list of the players that changes after each hand played. I think just putting the player at position 1 in the list to the end should solve the issue.
-Need to handle min raises
-Need to add some instructions on format of user input and a help menu at some point
-If the money needed to call puts the player all in, then there shouldnt be an option to "Raise"
-Deal with ChipsNeededToCall
-******Make a structured list of tasks and features
-care with the difference between the hand ending due to someone folding and due to the hand ending cause someone is all in. I might treat some variables in too much of a general way
-Need to account for someone being all in on the river and winning, but they cant get all the chips since they were short stack, I then need to assign those chips to the 2nd best hand and I suppose even one more time in a very rare scenario, I might be able to loop whatever process I create until the pot is "cleared"
-Care with how I determine kickers, if it is a straight/flush then I have no choice but to choose one of those 5 cards. With most other hands I can use any in the 7 availiable
-the ability to muck or show hands
-ensure I have functions in the correct class, there can be some ambiguity with some functions that could belong to both Dealer/Board and maybe player. Keep these in mind and try find ways to seperate the functions into clearer categories 
-too much hassle to check if the regEx can return 2 matches on its own, since you then to remove the first match and run the regEx again anyway.
-For some functions, determing the kicker can be more alike that initially thought. If I am in the scenario where I know exactly what cards I need to find the kicker from, then the process can be pretty similar.
-ideas for custom UI default "layer": 5 show cards, chip counts, players in the hand. See what can be done in terms of a makeshift table being created in CLI
-Error with DetermineHighestCardFromTwoChoices()
-At the moment if there is only one kicker, specifically, the best kicker outside the "hand" (e.g Pair). Winners will be awarded incorrectly in rare situations until more kickers added. It probs wouldnt be too hard to scale up how some of the kickers are determined. If I have a list of only cards I need to decide kickers from, then instead of just assigning the highest kicker, I can create a new list, add the highest kicker, remove it from the original list and perform the search again for the next highest kicker then add that to the new list and so forth
